# Packer Vars Example 

## Or, why does it have to be this hard?

This repo was created to provide an example to illustrate my comments on this Github issue for @nywilken who so graciously offered to understand the use-case and possibly even address the difficulty of my use-case.

## Use-case
Basically the use-case did the following, **each with its own `.pkr.hcl` file**. This process assumes an 'ova-builder` VM on VMware vCenter that will have been created by a different Packer template.

| Step      | Description                                                                  |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `setup`   | Ensures the 'ova-builder` VM is running and the vCenter has required config. |
| `clean`   | Ensures the VM is in a clean state, e.g. prior artifacts deleted.            |
| `app`     | Build a GoLang app on the VM.                                                |
| `iso`     | Builds a Linux ISO containing the GoLang App.                                |
| `upload`  | Uploads the build ISO to a vCenter Datastore.                                |
| `install` | Installs the ISO to create a new 'App' VM on vCenter.                        |
| `export`  | Exports the App VM back down to 'ova-builder' as an OVA file.                |
| `jfrog`   | Uploads the resulant OVA to jFrog Artifactory.                               |


The above is even a simplification but is hopefully detailed enough to give a clear picture of the process.

## Example
Aside from the code being proprietary and owned by a former client it would be far too complex to serve as a clarifying example, so I create the simplest example I could to illustrate the problem.

This example has two (2) steps: `step1` and `step2` and their respective Packer templates are `./step1/step1.pkr.hcl` and `./step2/step2.pkr.hcl`.  The example also has a shared `/vars.json` which contains shared vars for logging into SSH and one var for each step, `step1_var=foo` and `step2_var=bar`, respectively. 

All these steps do is they both use the null builder to reach into a Linux machine via SSH and then run an inline script echoing their variable's value.

### Running the working example
To see this example work:

1. Make sure you have Packer installed _(of course)_,
2. Clone this repo to a macOS or Linux machine.
3. Ensure you are in the `working` branch, which is the repo's default.
4. Run `make`


## The Problem
The problem is that Packer requires you to declare `step2_var` in `./step1/step1.pkr.hcl` even though /step1/step1.pkr.hcl` never references or otherwise uses `step2_var`, â€” as the following table illustrates:

| Step    | Packer Template         | Template Uses<br>property in<br>`./vars.json` | Template does<br>NOT use: |           
|---------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| `step1` | `./step1/step1.pkr.hcl` | `step1_var=foo`                               | `step2_var`               |
| `step2` | `./step2/step2.pkr.hcl` | `step2_var=bar`                               | `step1_var`               |


### Running the broken example

To experience the problem this repo is trying to illustrate:

1. Make sure performed the steps for the `working` example first.
2. Checkout the `broken` branch.
2. Run `make`
